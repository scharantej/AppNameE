 **Feedback Analysis**

The feedback from the previous runs highlighted several areas for improvement:

1. **Lack of user-friendly interface:** The design lacked an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it difficult for users to navigate and plan their vacations effectively.

2. **Insufficient route handling:** The application did not handle routes efficiently, resulting in broken links and missing pages.

3. **Incomplete HTML files:** Some of the HTML files were incomplete, affecting the overall functionality of the application.

**Improvements for This Run**

Based on the feedback received, I plan to make the following improvements in this run:

1. **Enhanced user interface:** I will focus on creating a more user-friendly interface by improving the layout, navigation, and overall visual design of the application. This will ensure a better user experience and make it easier for users to plan their vacations.

2. **Robust route handling:** I will implement proper route handling to ensure that all links and pages function correctly. This will involve creating clear and consistent routes, handling errors gracefully, and ensuring that the application responds appropriately to user actions.

3. **Complete HTML files:** I will ensure that all HTML files are complete and properly structured. This will include adding missing elements, correcting any errors, and ensuring that the HTML code is valid and conforms to standards.

By addressing these areas of improvement, I aim to create a more user-friendly, functional, and complete travel planner application that effectively meets the needs of users planning exotic vacations.
